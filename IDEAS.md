Based on your preferences for a futuristic yet minimal dark theme, here are several creative alternatives I can create for you:

üåå 1. Neural Cosmos Theme
Concept: Space-inspired with floating neural connections, particle systems, and constellation-like skill maps
Visual: Deep space background with animated stars, orbital skill categories, and galaxy-inspired navigation
Hero: 3D rotating brain model with data streams flowing through neural pathways
Colors: Deep purples, electric blues, and cosmic whites
üî¨ 2. Data Laboratory Theme
Concept: Scientific lab aesthetic with data visualization charts, molecular structures, and research paper layouts
Visual: Clean lab interface with animated data graphs, molecular bond animations for skills
Hero: Interactive data dashboard showing your impact metrics and AI model performance
Colors: Clinical whites, lab blues, and neon green accents
üéØ 3. Holographic Interface Theme
Concept: Sci-fi hologram projections with translucent panels and floating UI elements
Visual: Glitch effects, holographic overlays, and AR-style information panels
Hero: Your profile appears as a holographic projection with rotating stats
Colors: Cyan blues, holographic greens, and transparent gradients
‚ö° 4. Energy Grid Theme
Concept: Electric circuit board aesthetic with flowing energy paths and power nodes
Visual: Animated electrical currents connecting different sections, power-up effects
Hero: Central energy core with your info radiating outward through circuit paths
Colors: Electric yellows, neon oranges, and dark conductors
üåä 5. Liquid Data Theme
Concept: Fluid dynamics with flowing data streams, liquid animations, and wave patterns
Visual: Morphing liquid shapes, data flowing like water, ripple effects on hover
Hero: Your profile emerges from liquid data formations
Colors: Deep ocean blues, liquid teals, and bioluminescent accents
üîÆ 6. Quantum Realm Theme
Concept: Quantum physics inspired with particle effects, probability clouds, and dimensional shifts
Visual: Quantum tunneling animations, probability distribution charts, particle collisions
Hero: Quantum state superposition showing multiple versions of your skills simultaneously
Colors: Quantum purples, probability blues, and uncertainty grays
üéµ 7. Audio Waveform Theme
Concept: Sound visualization with audio waveforms, frequency spectrums, and rhythm patterns
Visual: Your data represented as music, animated equalizers, sound wave navigation
Hero: Your profile "plays" as an audio visualization with skills as different frequencies
Colors: Sound wave blues, frequency greens, and amplitude oranges
üèóÔ∏è 8. Architectural Blueprint Theme
Concept: Technical drawings and architectural plans showcasing your "construction" as an ML engineer
Visual: Blueprint grids, technical annotations, construction progress bars
Hero: Your career built like architectural plans with dimensional drawings
Colors: Blueprint blues, drafting whites, and annotation yellows
Which of these themes resonates most with you? I can create a completely new design based on any of these concepts, moving away from the code-centric approach while maintaining the futuristic minimal aesthetic you prefer.

Each theme would be:

‚úÖ Fully responsive and GitHub Pages compatible
‚úÖ Dark theme with your preferred minimal approach
‚úÖ Futuristic with unique interactive elements
‚úÖ Professional yet creative presentation of your ML/AI expertise
Let me know which direction excites you most, and I'll create a completely fresh design!
